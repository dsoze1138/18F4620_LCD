Code for the Stack Exchange topic: https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/537685/change-lcd-information-from-pic-using-push-buttons

This application was tested using the Microchip PICDEM2 Plus (DM163022-1) 

http://www.microchip.com/Developmenttools/ProductDetails.aspx?PartNO=DM163022-1

The Microchip PICDEM2 Plus (DM163022-1) is no longer available from Microchip.

The MPLABX Code Configurator was used to generate a lot of this code, but the MCC 
does not support the PIC18F4620. The PIC18F45K20 was used used with MPLABX v5.45 
to generate the code then the target was changed to the PIC18F4620 and the generated 
files were edited to make this mess work.
